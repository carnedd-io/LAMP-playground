# LAMP Playground

A quick playground in which you can experiment with PHP, MySQL, Javascript & HTML.

## Step 1: Fork It (and fork it good)
Fork to a new repo

## Step 2: Clone The Repo
Navigate to your projects directory 
````
cd ~/Projects
````

Clone the forked repository to your local machine 
````
git clone <repo-url-here> <folder-name-here>
````

## Step 3: Copy The Environment File

Navigate to the folder you just cloned.

Duplicate the .env.sample file to a file named '.env'

## Step 4: 
Fireup Docker
````
docker-compose up --build
````

## Step 5

Access the site in your browser, if you have changed no defaults it should be available at 
````
http://localhost:48090
````


## Step 6 

Have at yeee! 

## Further Notes

This is not a particuarly complex or secure environment, and is designed for testing purposes only on a local machine. 

If you want to run more than one of these projects simitaneously you will need to expose different ports
